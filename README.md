# Welcome to the Internship and New Grad Search Guide!

Attending a university where internships are never talked about, I learned most of what I know now from reddit, linkedin, or talking with upperclassmen. I still have not found a single place with all the information that I used to get my internships so I decided to write a one. In this guide, you will learn everything you need to know about getting an internship or new grad role and how I was able to get 7 internships in 4 years.

Please feel more than free to star, share with freinds, and suggest new sections by raising an issue or a pull request!

If you enjoy the guide and want to send a few dollars my way, send them to [Code.org](https://code.org/about/donors) instead.
