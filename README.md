# Internship and New Grad Search Guide

### Welcome! 

Attending a university where internships are never talked about, I learned most of what I know now from reddit, linkedin, or talking with upperclass men. I decided to write a one stop shop guide for all the things you need to know and all the things I did to get 7 interships in my 4 years at university.

If you enjoy the guide and want to send a few dollars my way, send them to [Code.org](https://code.org/about/donors) instead.
